# Foundations of Data Science

Python files implemented for the following problems:
- Use Decision Tree, Random Forests, KNN and LDA to predict whether the person will default. Compare the findings from different methods.
- Use PCA and SVD to reduce the dimensions of the data 2 so that the reduced data has 5, 10, 15 and 20 columns. Give an exploratory data analysis on SVS with 5 columns.
- Use linear regression and LDA on data 3 to predict whether a given suburb has a crime rate above or below the median. Compare the findings from different methods.
- Use the image given and compress it to 25%, 65% and 85% of the original image with SVD.
